Regularly\r\n              change your passwords. Also, create a username that is unique and\r\n              difficult for others to guess.

Financial\r\n              fraud is a crime. Call the Federal Trade Commission's ID Theft\r\n              hotline at (877) IDTHEFT to report it.

Victims of fraud should contact\r\n              their local post office to report any crime involving stolen mail\r\n              or use of the mail in furtherance of a fraud scheme. It is a\r\n              felony. Contact the Social Security Administration at (800)\r\n              269-0271. The Social Security Hotline allows a victim of identity\r\n              theft to report misuse of a Social Security number.
