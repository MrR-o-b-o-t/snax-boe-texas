DECIDING WHAT IS BEST\"\n      >\n        <strong>What’s the best scenario for you? Renting or owning?</strong>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        While it may seem that owning a home is the best choice, that might not\n        necessarily be the case for everyone. The key is to consider all the\n        factors, good and bad, that come with owning a home. Once you compare\n        renting versus owning, then you are ready to make the best decision for\n        your current situation. How much house can you afford?\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        If after considering all the contributing factors you conclude that\n        owning a home is the best decision, you next will want to think about\n        how much home you want to own. How much space will you need? How much\n        space can you afford? Knowing what you can afford in a home will help\n        drive your search in a focused direction. What type of housing suits you\n        best? When you determine how much home you can afford, you next can\n        consider what type of home and neighborhood best fits your needs. Before\n        you begin looking, if you start considering the differences between a\n        single-family home, a condo and the other housing options that exist,\n        you’ll save a lot of time and frustration in your search. Who do you\n        need on your team? Buying a home can be a strenuous process. You’ll want\n        to be sure to surround yourself with a team of professionals who can\n        assist you towards reaching your dream of homeownership.\n      </MDBAccordionItem>\n      <MDBAccordionItem\n        collapseId=\"panelsStayOpen-collapse2\"\n        headerTitle=\"2. LAYING THE FOUNDATION\"\n      >\n        <strong>\n          After deciding that buying a home is the best decision for you, what’s\n          next?\n        </strong>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <strong>BEING PREPARED</strong>\n        <br />\n        It will be good for you to evaluate how prepared you currently are to\n        buy a home. Perhaps you have been making steps towards this goal for a\n        while or maybe this is all new to you. Either way, the ways you have\n        equipped yourself for this venture will be major determining factors on\n        which loan program you choose. Do you have an amount for a down payment?\n        What is your income to debt ratio? How is your credit status? There are\n        a number of ways you can be prepared for this process.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <strong>OUR MONTHLY PAYMENT</strong>\n        <br />\n        Your next concern starts to be which loan program fits your needs and\n        how to structure your monthly mortgage payments. Before moving forward,\n        you’ll want to consider those items that make up your monthly payment\n        and the factors that influence them. Typically referenced as PITI, your\n        monthly mortgage payment is comprised of Principal, Interest, Taxes and\n        Insurance. The initial amount you borrow to purchase the home and the\n        remaining outstanding balance throughout the life of the loan is the\n        PRINCIPAL. The charge for borrowing money is the INTEREST. Collected in\n        an escrow account, your TAXES are assessed by your local government and\n        typically paid to your lender as a portion of your payment. The lender\n        will then pay them to the government upon their due date. Established in\n        a similar fashion as your taxes, INSURANCE is collected by the lender\n        and put into an escrow account. Your insurance is composed of two\n        prominent types of coverage. Homeowner’s insurance provides you coverage\n        for damages inflicted by hazards such as (but not limited to) wind and\n        fire. Mortgage insurance typically is required for those making a\n        smaller down payment on their loan; it provides protection for your\n        lender in the instance that you are not able to fulfill the mortgage\n        requirements and repay your loan.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <strong>COMMON CONCERN</strong>\n        <br />\n        One of the issues that most concerns homeowners is their mortgage\n        interest rate. This is for good reason as the interest rate directly\n        affects the monthly payments for the life of the loan. Because of this,\n        homebuyers search for steps they can take to obtain the lowest rate\n        available. Contributing factors to the interest rate include whether the\n        homebuyer decides to: select a fixed or adjustable rate pay discount\n        points choose a short or long term loan There are other special\n        considerations that you may want to consider as you evaluate your\n        mortgage options.\n      </MDBAccordionItem>\n      <MDBAccordionItem\n        collapseId=\"panelsStayOpen-collapse3\"\n        headerTitle=\"3. PUTTING IT TOGETHER\"\n      >\n        <strong>\n          With your decision made and the groundwork laid, it’s time to put all\n          the pieces of documentation needed to move forward into closing.\n        </strong>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <strong>Prequalified</strong>\n        <br />\n        In a prequalification letter, the lender has been provided the buyer’s\n        financial details and, based on verification of these details, agrees to\n        give a loan to the buyer. A credit report is not required at this point.\n        Why Bother? Knowing how excited many homebuyers can be, it can seem\n        frustrating to add a step before the house hunt. However, there are\n        several advantages to being prequalified/preapproved that can make it\n        worthwhile. Credit challenges or problems that might prevent\n        qualification are discovered and addressed early in the process. You\n        will be able to house hunt with confidence knowing that the financial\n        backing that is available to you.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <strong>\n          Home sellers typically see more strength in offers from prequalified\n          buyers.\n        </strong>\n        <br />\n        For self-employed or commission-based buyers, a prequalification letter\n        can demonstrate financial backing for buyers whose incomes may fluctuate\n        more than those of salaried buyers and therefore possibly demonstrate\n        more risk. Prequalification letters show that the lender is willing to\n        move forward with the loan for first-time homebuyers even though they\n        may lack a credit history that demonstrates their ability to make\n        monthly mortgage payments. It helps equalize their offer with similar\n        offers made by previous homeowners.\n      </MDBAccordionItem>\n      <MDBAccordionItem\n        collapseId=\"panelsStayOpen-collapse3\"\n        headerTitle=\"4.
