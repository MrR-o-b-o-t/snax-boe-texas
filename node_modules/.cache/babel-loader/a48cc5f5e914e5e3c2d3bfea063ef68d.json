Regularly\r\n              change your passwords. Also, create a username that is unique and\r\n              difficult for others to guess.

Call the three major\r\n              credit bureaus to request that a fraud alert be placed on your\r\n              credit report. Contact your local police department. Financial\r\n              fraud is a crime. Call the Federal Trade Commission's ID Theft\r\n              hotline at (877) IDTHEFT to report it. The FTC maintains a program\r\n              to assist victims of identity theft. The Center logs complaints\r\n              and provides assistance and information to victimized consumers to\r\n              rectify damage to their credit and personal reputation. Notify the\r\n              U.S. Postal Inspectors Office. Victims of fraud should contact\r\n              their local post office to report any crime involving stolen mail\r\n              or use of the mail in furtherance of a fraud scheme. It is a\r\n              felony. Contact the Social Security Administration at (800)\r\n              269-0271. The Social Security Hotline allows a victim of identity\r\n              theft to report misuse of a Social Security number. You may also\r\n              visit your local Social Security Office to obtain further\r\n              information. Contact the Department of Motor Vehicles. If your\r\n              driver's license is stolen, report the theft immediately to your\r\n              local Department of Motor Vehicles. Ensure that a duplicate\r\n              license was not recently issued in your name to an imposter. Keep\r\n              detailed notes of your repair efforts. Keep a log of all contacts\r\n              and copies of all documents; follow up your contact calls in\r\n              writing.
