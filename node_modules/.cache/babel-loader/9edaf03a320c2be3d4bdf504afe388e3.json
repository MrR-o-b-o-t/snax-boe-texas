When you find a great\r\n          match, you’ll want to take those next steps that can make that home\r\n          yours.\r\n        </strong>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <strong>EXTENDING AN OFFER</strong>\r\n        <br />\r\n        Purchasing a home is one of the few transactions that involves heavy\r\n        negotiations. A REALTOR is a valuable resource to have on your side as\r\n        you determine the appropriate initial offer to extend. During this\r\n        portion of the process, you’ll want to consider the following:\r\n        <br />\r\n        <ul className=\"mt-2\">\r\n          <li className=\"mb-2\">\r\n            To demonstrate the strong financial backing and genuineness of your\r\n            offer, you’ll want to have the pre-approval letter from your Bank Of\r\n            England Loan Officer ready. An offer with financial security\r\n            obviously is preferred by sellers.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li className=\"mb-2\">\r\n            Facilitate all your negotiations in writing. This will provide a\r\n            record of deals and decisions made as well as help clarify any\r\n            misunderstandings.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li className=\"mb-2\">\r\n            To demonstrate the seriousness of your offer, you’ll want to have\r\n            money ready to use as an earnest money (or “good faith”) deposit.\r\n            While the amount varies depending on your location, all of it will\r\n            be placed into an escrow account until the purchase transaction is\r\n            complete.\r\n          </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <strong>THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT</strong>\r\n        <br />\r\n        A legally binding contract between the buyer and the seller of the\r\n        property, the purchase agreement outlines all terms and features of the\r\n        final transaction. This can include:\r\n        <br />\r\n        <ul className=\"mt-2\">\r\n          <li className=\"mb-2\">\r\n            The sales price, the loan amount, the down payment and deposit\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li className=\"mb-2\">\r\n            The names of all parties involved including the buyer, the seller,\r\n            the buyer’s agent, the seller’s agent, the mortgage broker/banker\r\n            and any attorneys\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li className=\"mb-2\">\r\n            Time limits that might apply to the transaction\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li className=\"mb-2\">\r\n            Any contingencies that must be addressed prior to the deal being\r\n            complete and finalized (such as the sale of the buyer’s present\r\n            home, issues from the home inspection that might need to be\r\n            repaired, etc…)\r\n          </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        Because of special and unique features of every home transaction and the\r\n        varying needs of each home buyer and home seller, purchase contracts are\r\n        not exactly the same. A REALTOR, a title company or an attorney may\r\n        assist in the negotiations and execution of a purchase contract; this is\r\n        dependent on the state in which the transaction is being conducted.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <strong>AT CLOSING</strong>\r\n        <br />\r\n        The closer you get to the appointment, the more you will want to know\r\n        what to expect at closing.\r\n      </MDBAccordionItem>\r\n    </MDBAccordion>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
