After 2 years I was given the opportunity to run my own branch, and have since successfully navigated through the ups and downs of the mortgage industry. In November of 2016 our team joined Bank of England Mortgage. From the start I knew that we had finally found a place to call home! I believe that the difference between one lender to the next is NOT the company, interest rate, or closing costs. We all borrower from the same billionaires. The difference is the level of commitment to our clients, attention to detail, and the speed that we can get your loan ready for closing. Choosing the right lender is vital to having a great experience during the loan process and our commitment to our clients is our companys most important principal. We don't want to earn your business on only one mortgage transaction. We want to earn your business on ALL of your mortgage transactions now and in the future. Contact us today if you or anybody you know is interested in purchasing or refinancing a home. If youre interestedin coming to work for an excellent company and wanting to partner with a reliable FDIC member bank that is a nationwide lender, please contact me directly at; (214) 483 9201 or email: mlepp@boemortgage.com",
