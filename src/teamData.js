He began his career in finance in the year 2005, and worked for Citi Bank, Washington Mutual and Chase Bank before joining Bank of England Mortgage as a Sr. Loan officer in 2016. His experience in bank management taught him the importance of exceptional customer service, and he applies that experience to every interaction he has with a client. He loves working with Bank of England Mortgage because as a boutique bank, they have great lending programs that can be tailored to fit each clients needs. I enjoy being part of the process and helping clients get the right financing for their homes.",

    bio: "In July of 2004 1 year after graduating from The University of North Texas with a degree in Applied Economics, I started as a Loan Officer Assistant. 1 month later I became Loan Officer and quickly became one of the top producers inthe company. After 2 years I was given the opportunity to run my own branch, and have since successfully navigated through the ups and downs of the mortgage industry. In November of 2016 our team joined Bank of England Mortgage. From the start I knew that we had finally found a place to call home! I believe that the difference between one lender to the next is NOT the company, interest rate, or closing costs. We all borrower from the same billionaires. The difference is the level of commitment to our clients, attention to detail, and the speed that we can get your loan ready for closing. Choosing the right lender is vital to having a great experience during the loan process and our commitment to our clients is our companys most important principal. We don't want to earn your business on only one mortgage transaction. We want to earn your business on ALL of your mortgage transactions now and in the future. Contact us today if you or anybody you know is interested in purchasing or refinancing a home. If youre interestedin coming to work for an excellent company and wanting to partner with a reliable FDIC member bank that lends in all 50 states, please contact me directly at; (214) 483 9201 or email: mlepp@boemortgage.com",
