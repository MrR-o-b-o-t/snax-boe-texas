        <strong>What’s the best scenario for you? Renting or owning?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        While it may seem that owning a home is the best choice, that might not
        necessarily be the case for everyone. The key is to consider all the
        factors, good and bad, that come with owning a home. Once you compare
        renting versus owning, then you are ready to make the best decision for
        your current situation. How much house can you afford?
        <br />
        <br />
        If after considering all the contributing factors you conclude that
        owning a home is the best decision, you next will want to think about
        how much home you want to own. How much space will you need? How much
        space can you afford? Knowing what you can afford in a home will help
        drive your search in a focused direction. What type of housing suits you
        best? When you determine how much home you can afford, you next can
        consider what type of home and neighborhood best fits your needs. Before
        you begin looking, if you start considering the differences between a
        single-family home, a condo and the other housing options that exist,
        you’ll save a lot of time and frustration in your search. Who do you
        need on your team? Buying a home can be a strenuous process. You’ll want
        to be sure to surround yourself with a team of professionals who can
        assist you towards reaching your dream of homeownership.

          After deciding that buying a home is the best decision for you, what’s
          next?
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>BEING PREPARED</strong>
        <br />
        It will be good for you to evaluate how prepared you currently are to
        buy a home. Perhaps you have been making steps towards this goal for a
        while or maybe this is all new to you. Either way, the ways you have
        equipped yourself for this venture will be major determining factors on
        which loan program you choose. Do you have an amount for a down payment?
        What is your income to debt ratio? How is your credit status? There are
        a number of ways you can be prepared for this process.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>OUR MONTHLY PAYMENT</strong>
        <br />
        Your next concern starts to be which loan program fits your needs and
        how to structure your monthly mortgage payments. Before moving forward,
        you’ll want to consider those items that make up your monthly payment
        and the factors that influence them. Typically referenced as PITI, your
        monthly mortgage payment is comprised of Principal, Interest, Taxes and
        Insurance. The initial amount you borrow to purchase the home and the
        remaining outstanding balance throughout the life of the loan is the
        PRINCIPAL. The charge for borrowing money is the INTEREST. Collected in
        an escrow account, your TAXES are assessed by your local government and
        typically paid to your lender as a portion of your payment. The lender
        will then pay them to the government upon their due date. Established in
        a similar fashion as your taxes, INSURANCE is collected by the lender
        and put into an escrow account. Your insurance is composed of two
        prominent types of coverage. Homeowner’s insurance provides you coverage
        for damages inflicted by hazards such as (but not limited to) wind and
        fire. Mortgage insurance typically is required for those making a
        smaller down payment on their loan; it provides protection for your
        lender in the instance that you are not able to fulfill the mortgage
        requirements and repay your loan.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>COMMON CONCERN</strong>
        <br />
        One of the issues that most concerns homeowners is their mortgage
        interest rate. This is for good reason as the interest rate directly
        affects the monthly payments for the life of the loan. Because of this,
        homebuyers search for steps they can take to obtain the lowest rate
        available. Contributing factors to the interest rate include whether the
        homebuyer decides to: select a fixed or adjustable rate pay discount
        points choose a short or long term loan There are other special
        considerations that you may want to consider as you evaluate your
        mortgage options.

        <strong>
          With your decision made and the groundwork laid, it’s time to put all
          the pieces of documentation needed to move forward into closing.
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Prequalified</strong>
        <br />
        In a prequalification letter, the lender has been provided the buyer’s
        financial details and, based on verification of these details, agrees to
        give a loan to the buyer. A credit report is not required at this point.
        Why Bother? Knowing how excited many homebuyers can be, it can seem
        frustrating to add a step before the house hunt. However, there are
        several advantages to being prequalified/preapproved that can make it
        worthwhile. Credit challenges or problems that might prevent
        qualification are discovered and addressed early in the process. You
        will be able to house hunt with confidence knowing that the financial
        backing that is available to you.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
          Home sellers typically see more strength in offers from prequalified
          buyers.
        </strong>
        <br />
        For self-employed or commission-based buyers, a prequalification letter
        can demonstrate financial backing for buyers whose incomes may fluctuate
        more than those of salaried buyers and therefore possibly demonstrate
        more risk. Prequalification letters show that the lender is willing to
        move forward with the loan for first-time homebuyers even though they
        may lack a credit history that demonstrates their ability to make
        monthly mortgage payments. It helps equalize their offer with similar
        offers made by previous homeowners.

          With the groundwork laid and the financial backing that comes from
          being prequalified in place, you can begin the house hunt with
          confidence. One thing to decide early on is if you would prefer to do
          this search alone or with the benefits that come from working with a
          licensed REALTOR.

        <br />
        <br />
        Now is also a good time to come up with a wish list for your home. When
        you do, consider the following:
        <ul className="mt-2">
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Type of Neighborhood:</strong> No matter how much you love
            the home you end up buying, you have to remember that it is not
            isolated from the rest of the world. Is it near areas of the city
            that are important to you and your family? Is it in the school
            district you desire for your children? Does the neighborhood appear
            to be a good fit for you and your family today and in the future?{" "}
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Type of Homes:</strong> As discussed earlier, there are
            several types of homes out there, each one providing different
            options in terms of space, responsibilities, upkeep, and ownership.
            Consider the different factors that would make either a
            single-family home, a condominium, a townhome or a co-op the best
            choice for you.{" "}
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Features of the Home:</strong> What do you need in a home
            and what do you want in a home? Would you like a one-story or
            two-story home? How many bedrooms and bathrooms would you need?
            Would you like an at home office? What type of backyard would you
            like? Consider all the different features and prioritize the
            features of the home you’d like to have.

          At some point of your search, you’ll know. You’ll know when you find
          the home that best fits you and your needs. When you find a great

        <strong>EXTENDING AN OFFER</strong>
        <br />
        Purchasing a home is one of the few transactions that involves heavy
        negotiations. A REALTOR is a valuable resource to have on your side as
        you determine the appropriate initial offer to extend. During this
        portion of the process, you’ll want to consider the following:
        <br />
        <ul className="mt-2">
          <li className="mb-2">
            To demonstrate the strong financial backing and genuineness of your
            offer, you’ll want to have the pre-approval letter from your Bank Of
            England Loan Officer ready. An offer with financial security
            obviously is preferred by sellers.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            Facilitate all your negotiations in writing. This will provide a
            record of deals and decisions made as well as help clarify any
            misunderstandings.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            To demonstrate the seriousness of your offer, you’ll want to have
            money ready to use as an earnest money (or “good faith”) deposit.
            While the amount varies depending on your location, all of it will
            be placed into an escrow account until the purchase transaction is
            complete.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT</strong>
        <br />
        A legally binding contract between the buyer and the seller of the
        property, the purchase agreement outlines all terms and features of the
        final transaction. This can include:
        <br />
        <ul className="mt-2">
          <li className="mb-2">
            The sales price, the loan amount, the down payment and deposit
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            The names of all parties involved including the buyer, the seller,
            the buyer’s agent, the seller’s agent, the mortgage broker/banker
            and any attorneys
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            Time limits that might apply to the transaction
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            Any contingencies that must be addressed prior to the deal being
            complete and finalized (such as the sale of the buyer’s present
            home, issues from the home inspection that might need to be
            repaired, etc…)
          </li>
        </ul>
        Because of special and unique features of every home transaction and the
        varying needs of each home buyer and home seller, purchase contracts are
        not exactly the same. A REALTOR, a title company or an attorney may
        assist in the negotiations and execution of a purchase contract; this is
        dependent on the state in which the transaction is being conducted.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>AT CLOSING</strong>
        <br />
        The closer you get to the appointment, the more you will want to know
        what to expect at closing.
